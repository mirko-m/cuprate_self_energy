# cuprate_self_energy

This repository contains contour plots of the self-energy of a single hole doped into a CuO2 layer. Since this is an ongoing project I cannot upload the code that was used to generate the data, but if you are interested please feel free to contact me. There is a jupyter notebook with plots of the data and more information on the model.
